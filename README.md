# Maze_SolverBot_ArduinoProject
Autonomous navigation is a crucial feature that enables a mobile robot to autonomously go from one point to another without the aid of a human operator. The robot must find its way through a maze of obstacles by researching, identifying, and charting the environment it is in. It is possible to research and improve the relevant robot behavior and algorithms. This paper describes a robot maze-solver implementation for a flood-fill algorithm-based maze. The maze's entrances were located using the ultrasonic sensors. The robot was able to explore the maze and select the fastest path among all feasible routes to finish it thanks to PI and the Arduino code, the straight-line correction controller method.
